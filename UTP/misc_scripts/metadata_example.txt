# text-file containing metadata to be sourced into the build_annotation.R script

version <- "0.1"
maintainer <- "Some One <so@someplace.org>"
author <- "Some One <so@someplace.org>"
tax_id <- "59729"
genus <- "Taeniopygia"
species <- "guttata"

# notes:
# * the author and maintainer do not need to be identical
# * make sure the e-mail adress is within ( <> )
# * if the created package is not publicized, the e-mail adress need not be valid
# * do not change the left side of the arrows ( <- ) and always put the text behind in ( "" )
# * best practice: do not modify this file, but make a copy to modify instead
